    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most epic noodle dishes in the world from the streets of Malaysia: Char Kway Teow! Big flavours, contrasting textures and the signature hint of charred smokiness, this is bold South East Asian food at its best!</p>
    <p>What may seem to be quite a straightforward stir fried noodle dish is actually a bit of an art that’s been perfected by Malaysian street hawkers, and it’s taken me this long to share the recipe because I wanted to ensure I could make it doable for anyone.</p>

    <p><em>Serves 2-3</em></p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix Sauce Together</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Noodles</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Do not attempt to pull noodles apart while cold and hard - they break. </li>
        <li>Place whole packet in microwave, heat on high for 1 1/2 minutes - 2 minutes until warm and pliable, not hot, turning packet over as needed.</li>
        <li>Handle carefully and measure out 500g/1 lb noodles into a heatproof bowl. Separate noodles stuck together.</li>
        <li>If noodles become cold and brittle before cooking, cover with cling wrap and microwave for 30 seconds to make warm (not hot, just warm) to reduce breakage.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Cooking</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large non stick skillet over high heat.</li>
        <li>When heated, add shrimp and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until just cooked through, then remove into bowl</li>
        <li>Add Chinese sausage and fish cake, and cook for 1 minute until sausage is caramelised, then add to bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tbsp oil then add egg and cook, pushing in the edges to make a thick omelette. Once set, chop it up roughly using a wooden spoon (see video), then add to bowl.</li>
        <li>Add bean sprouts and cook for about 1 minute until just starting to wilt, then add to bowl.</li>
        <li>Add lard. Once melted and starting to smoke, add garlic then immediately add noodles. Fold gently 4 times using a spatula + wooden spoon (see video) just to disperse oil through noodles.</li>
        <li>Tip all the other ingredients back in plus the chives. Fold gently twice, then pour all the Sauce over.</li>
        <li>Gently toss 4 to 6 times to disperse the sauce, pausing in between to allow the noodles to have a chance to caramelise on the edges a bit.</li>
        <li>Remove from stove and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
